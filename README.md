# MyCal
MyCal is a personal calorie and meal, macronutrient, and exercise tracker.

It was built to be fully customizable in its database, simple and easy to use, and ad-free (I can not stand ads in applications like this).

It is private (authentication only works if you are manually added to the user database) but one day might be opened if there is interest.
